# In Python, error handling can be done using a `try`/`except` block. Implement
# `except` blocks to handle the exceptions that will be raised for the following
# `try` blocks:

# Example 1
# try:
#     string = 'hello'
#     string[0] = 'm'
#     print(str)
# except TypeError as error:
#     print('Strings are Immutable', error)
# finally:
#     print('I happen regardless of any exceptions.')

# # Example 2
# try:
#     print(x)
# except NameError as error:
#     print('Variable x is not defined', error)
# finally:
#     print('I happen regardless of any exceptions.')
