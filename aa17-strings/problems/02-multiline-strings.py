# It's time to write your first multiline of code in Python. Use the `print` to
# send a multiline message with a quote in it to the terminal.

# Here is an example of using print to display message to the user:

print('''In this code include "quotes"
of any kind because they won't get confused with
the end of the string!''')

# Display your own message using print below:

print('''"Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not.
      It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you.
      It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful
      and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to
      create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even
      keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway
      to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful…
      the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did.
      Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him
      in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself."''')
